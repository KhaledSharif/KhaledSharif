### Hi there 👋

I'm Khaled, a robotics software engineer at Pebble. Previously I worked at NASA building [Astrobee](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee) and [VIPER](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/viper)

Currently working on various personal projects related to machine learning and robotics:

[ros-vslam](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/ros-vslam) has code for running Visual SLAM in ROS with GPU acceleration and testing in a photo realistic simulation

[omniverse-gym](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/omniverse-gym) shows how to use Omniverse Isaac Sim to solve robot reinforcement learning tasks using PPO

[robot-transformers](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/robot-transformers) shows how to use Action Chunking Transformers to solve various robot arm manipluation tasks
