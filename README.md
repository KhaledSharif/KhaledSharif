### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Khaled, a robotics software engineer at NASA working on [Astrobee](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee)

Currently working on various personal projects related to machine learning and robotics:

[nvidia-omniverse-examples](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/nvidia-omniverse-examples) contains examples of how to use NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim to solve RL-Games.

[scikit-robot-examples](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/scikit-robot-examples) contains examples of how to use Scikit-Robot for robotic arm inverse kinematics.

[openrag](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/openrag) makes local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) easier by combining ollama + dspy + chroma
