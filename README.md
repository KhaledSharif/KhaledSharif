### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Khaled, a robotics software engineer at NASA working on [Astrobee](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee)

Currently working on various personal projects related to machine learning and robotics:

[openrag](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/openrag) makes local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) easier by combining ollama + dspy + chroma

[ros2-vslam](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/ros2-vslam) has quickstart python code for Visual SLAM in ROS2 with GPU acceleration and testing in simulation

[nvidia-omniverse-examples](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/nvidia-omniverse-examples) has examples of how to use NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim to solve robot RL tasks

[scikit-robot-examples](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/scikit-robot-examples) has examples of how to use Scikit-Robot to visualize robot arm inverse kinematics

[hf-robot-examples](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/hf-robot-examples) has examples of how to use HuggingFace LeRobot for various robot tasks (ALOHA, PushT, xArm)
