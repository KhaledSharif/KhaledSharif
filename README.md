### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Khaled, a robotics software engineer 

I'm currently working on a few open source robotics projects:

[nvidia-omniverse-examples](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/nvidia-omniverse-examples) contains examples of how to use NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim to solve Reinforcement Learning Games.

[scikit-robot-examples](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/scikit-robot-examples) contains examples of how to use Scikit Robot for robotic arm simulation and inverse kinematics.

As well as various machine learning projects:

[openrag](https://github.com/KhaledSharif/openrag) makes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) easier by combining ollama + dspy + chromadb and contains a minimal Wikipedia example.
